# Data Science Final Reflection
	
Data science is a powerful tool to model, predict, and better understand patterns of human behavior and development. Through the ability to analyze and model everything from human movement across geographical regions to the factors that most heavily influence economic behavior, data science is providing new avenues for studying human behavior by developing methods that can observe, connect, analyze, and predict underlying patterns found in the behavior of humans beyond what the human brain is capable of. 

In recent years, the evolution of data science has opened up new avenues to analyzing complex data. The ease at which data scientists can now model geospatial regions is astounding. In this introductory course alone, we learned how to model human settlements, predict spatial values, and project and plot data--everything from night time lights to topography--describing these human settlements. These factors can help indicate human development and watch its progression. For example, the night time lights can be an indicator of settlement patterns, culture (like, for example, how North Korea will be a dark spot in the night due to their regulations), and be watched through time to notice changes. As Geoff West noted, data science allows for “constructing, testing, and refining our theories and models” in every facet of describing human behavior and development and these improvements are developing rapidly. A couple decades ago, the most advanced data science methods relied on things like simple tree diagrams. This method has evolved into programs as sophisticated as XGBoost, a machine learning model that develops models to correct the errors of their predecessors by design. It quite literally “refin[es] our theories and models” itself.As humans better learn how to compile and map data, they also develop new methods in analyzing this data that can provide unique and valuable insights. Topological Data Analysis companies topology methods with data science, analyzing data as a physical space. This method has tremendous promise in aiding in the analysis of community and large scale behavior, as it specializes in finding patterns of data that might not otherwise be obvious. 

New data science technology has also led to major breakthroughs in analyzing human behavior and economics, specifically in the field of behavioral economics. This is a field that is centered around learning how humans make economic decisions. While traditional economic models assume that humans behave as rational beings, behavioral economics looks at the other factors that influence human economic decisions--including emotion, impulse, advertising, bandwagon, and others. Data science is providing behavioral economists new and effective ways to observe this and model these more complex theories of behavior. This type of machine learning doesn’t look at economics as a logical model, but rather “an evolutionary system,” just as Georgescu-Roegen claims, dependent on complex and constantly evolving factors of human nature and theory. It doesn’t assume economic systems to be static or stationary. It sees them almost as living organisms, fluctuating and evolving constantly, built on more than just logic, but interwoven with the fundamentals of human behavior. 

Data science is crucial to this study, as oftentimes the causes and effects are too complex for simple models or human analysis. Technologies like machine learning, however, are able to analyze large amounts of data, sort, characterize, and learn from it. For example, machine learning has been used to analyze consumer behavior in order to both predict behavior and determine the factors--nudges--that are most influential in deciding this behavior. Machine learning programs such as these are effective in observing human economic behavior on both the large and individual scale. They allow for messaging to be targeted towards individuals, as messengers utilize the nudges found most effective for the individual, and also reveal large scale patterns about what factors tend to influence human behavior the most. 

While data science and the ability to observe and analyze human behavior has generated significant new knowledge, it also poses some risks. Technology, such as nudges intended to manipulate consumer behavior, presents an ethical dilemma. It sacrifices both the privacy of individuals, as well as some degree of transparency, as those that use it intend to manipulate their consumers. This can reduce the freedoms of humanity, as our experiences are manipulated and dictated. For example, while nudges are useful tools for advertisers or can be used for things like encouraging people to use renewable energy, they can also be used by those who wish to increase political polarization or encourage people to spend money unnecessarily. 

At the same time, data science has significant potential to improve the human condition. As Aral claims, before a revolution in science, there will be a “revolution in measurement.” Right now, that is what data science is doing. It is providing new ways to measure, compile, and map data. Projects like the Human Connectome Project, that aim to map the complete structure and function of the human brain, is an example of the way that data science is transforming modern scientific understanding. Previously, scientists could only estimate function of areas of the brain with very general understanding and all mappings sorted the brain into its major structures, though little was able to be seen about the underlying connection between each of these structures. Now, with this new data science project and interorganizational cooperation, scientists are beginning to better measure and model neural networks. This technology has incredible implications for medical and psychological knowledge. Researchers are already using this technology to find predictors and signals of neurodegenerative diseases in individuals that could not previously be detected. With the improvements in understanding the underlying patterns of the brain using machine learning, eventually there will come a “revolution in science” and medicine that seeks to better the human condition (find cures for neurodegenerative diseases, better treat mental illness…) based on this knowledge. 

While there are risks, data science allows for new ways to collect, measure, interpret, evaluate, and predict information that has extreme benefits to society. From human economic behavioral predictors to models of settlements and the potential for medical applications, data science is critical to advancing our understanding of the complex systems that define humanity.
