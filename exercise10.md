# Project 2 Part 3

For this part of the project, I was looking at investing $10,000 in various stocks with the aim to make a profit. As all of the stocks I used in the previous part of the lab had negative trends over the two year time period, I used a different set of stocks. I chose to look specifically into companies that focused on genetics, including Illumina, Inc. (ILMN), Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (SRPT), Pacific Biosciences of California Inc (PACB), Agilent Technologies Inc (A), and Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN). Using tibbles, I was able to combine the data for the various stocks. Then I placed weights for each, indicating what percentage of the $10,000 I would invest in each. Finally, I made two different charts to depict the profits made. The first is a bar plot that shows the gains and losses of each month, along with a line indicating the average that shows that there is positive profit being earned. The second plot is a line plot that shows the growth over the two year time period.
