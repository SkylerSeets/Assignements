# Project 2 Part 2

The first image is the graph showing the relationship between the various stock prices. For this, I chose 5 stocks total, with four being predictor stocks. I was interested in seeing if news media had any impact on energy, and so my four predictor stocks included the New York Times (NYT), Tribune Publishing Company (TPCO), News Corps Class A (NWSA), and News Corps Class B (NWS), and my fifth stock was Exxon Mobile (XOM). As can be seen from the results, there does not seem to be a strong corrlation between any of the news companies and Exxon mobile. In general, they are mostly clustered around the center with slight positive trends, but these are not significant. The second image is a snapshot of the data description of the graphs. As can be seen by observing the r-squared value, there is not a strong correlation between the predictor stocks and the fifth stock.
