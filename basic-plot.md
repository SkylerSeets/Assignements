This is a basic plot using RStudio. First, I set the bounds on the variables x and y and then directed the program to make a plot with dotted lines running through boxed squares at each point. Then, I designated the various labels on the graph, using main, sub, xlab, and ylab to denote where each label should go. In addition, I included additional basic information, such as that the color of the graph should be blue by denoting col="blue".
