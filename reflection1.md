## Machine Learning and Behavioral Economics

One field in which data science has recently become more prominent is that of behavioral economics. In late 2019, two researchers in Singapore published a paper outlining new technology that brings together machine learning and behavioral economics through the concept of personalized choice architecture and nudges. Personalized choice architecture is a concept wherein machine learning is used in order to predict consumer behavior. A nudge is a term used to describe an effort to influence this behavior. In the context of nudges and personalized choice architecture, a machine learning algorithm describes a program that analyzes consumer behavior in order to predict not only the behavior but determine which factors (nudges) are most influential in deciding this behavior. In the past, nudges have been used in the sense of influencing mass behavior (think advertisements and subliminal messaging). This new technology, however, could aid in nudging at an individual level. 

In general, machine learning functions first by creating algorithms to analyze large data sets and looking for generalizable models for this data. Then, the algorithm is tested against data sets with known outcomes to see the accuracy of its predictions. If this is reliably accurate, it can then be applied to data sets with unknown outcomes to predict behavior. In the context of behavioral economics and nudges, the algorithm analyzes consumer behavior (along with demographic information) and the nudges present to determine the effectiveness of a given nudge. It looks at individual traits, a particular nudge, and the outcome (whether the person bought or did not). Machine learning works not just by analyzing existing data sets, but also by running its own experiments and developing based on the outcomes. By assigning various nudges to groups of people en masse, the algorithm is able to observe in an active context the correlation between each nudge and personal trait. Then, a model is able to be made which can predict the likely effectiveness of a given nudge on an individual’s behavior based on their personal traits. The algorithm can also compare the effectiveness of nudges against nothing to see which nudges actually diminish the likelihood of a consumer buying a product and which ones have no discernible effect, along with which types of people either of these cases are true for. 

As the purpose of this technology is to influence behavior based on determinants of what is most effective in influencing behavior, there are many uses for it within the field of behavioral economics and others. Marketing teams could use the insights provided by the machine learning algorithms in order to better advertise to online shoppers and target individual consumers more effectively. In addition, it can be useful in the fields of healthcare, business, and conservation. Nudges can be used to encourage people to follow post-doctor’s-appointment instructions, fill out paperwork, or buy more renewable energy. On the other hand, there are many threats posed by this type of technology as well. As this is technology based on influencing and manipulating the decision making of individuals, it presents many ethical dilemmas and could cause concern for those uncomfortable with the idea of being manipulated by large corporations.
