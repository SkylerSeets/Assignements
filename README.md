# Projects and Exercises
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Skyler Seets and I'm from Minnetonka, Minnesota, though my family recently moved to College Station, Texas. Academically, I am interested studying human behavior through a STEM perspective, though I don't know yet what I want to major in. Outside of school, I am interested in legislative climate change issues and play the alto sax and piano.
