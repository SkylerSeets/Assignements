# Data Science Reflection #2: Human Connectome

The Human Connectome Project is a project that is aiming to use mass amounts of neurobiological data in order to map the complete structure and function of the human brain. A partnership between many different organizations, research labs, and disciplines, this project seeks to both share and collect data in order to create a model or set of information that can be used to better address questions regarding human cognition. This is part of an emerging field of neuroscience, that focuses specifically on connections within the human brain and has many interdisciplinary connections to data science, called connectomics.
In order for this to occur, the leaders of the project are collecting large amounts of data, including information from twin studies, genomic information, high resolution neuroimaging data, and other neural research, and sorting and comparing this information to create a more complete image of the human neural system and pathways. Data science is crucial to this project, as it allows the researchers to sort and process the information and view the areas where there might be variations in, for example, white matter fiber pathways or perhaps correlations between certain attributes. 
Projects have been spurred on by the Connectome, as well. Purdue University’s Integrative Data Science Initiative has a project where a group of researchers are using data from connectome to create a method that would use data-driven tools in order to help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative disorders. An important aspect of this project is in the idea of evaluating individual “fingerprints” of a human functional connectome, or essentially being able to create inferences about an individual’s connectome (or neural mapping) based on the broader existing data set. This method would allow clinicians to identify and track changes in the brain over time, compare it to models describing the connections and communications of different regions over the brain, and better assess which regions are and are not functioning within the brain and what that may signify. Rather than just analyzing behavior, they are determined to create a graphical analysis that would allow doctors to see symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases earlier and more accurately.
