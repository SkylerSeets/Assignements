# Project 3 Part 2

For this section, I created two detail maps. In order to do this, I first created an object to describe the region and filtered by name in order to only select the region I wanted. Then, I created a plot of this adm1 region and included all of the adm2 regions, plus a title and subtitle to describe the region. The two regions I picked were Vilniaus and Kaunas, Lithuania's first and second most populous regions.
